	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of contact detection in discrete element multibody dynamic simulations. We present an overview of the problem and a detail description of a new object representation scheme called the discrete function representation (DFR). This representation is designed to reduce the computational cost of both contact detection and the more difficult problem of contact resolution. The scheme has a maximum theoretical complexity of order O(N) for contact resolution between bodies defined by N boundary points. In practice, the discrete element method constrains overlap between objects and the actual complexity is approximately O(ÓÄÅ(N) giving a speedup of nearly 2 orders of magnitude over traditional algorithms for systems withmore than 1000 objects. The technique is robust and is able to handle convexand concave object geometries, including objects containing holes. Examples of relatively large discrete element simulations in three dimensions are presented.},

	Abstract = {Additive manufacturing constitutes a promising production technology with potential application in a broad range of industrial areas. In this type of manufacturing process, objects are created from powder particles by adding layers of material upon one another through selectively melting particles from the powder bed. However, understanding the mechanical behavior of the powder during manufacturing as a function of material properties and particle shape is an essential pre-requisite for optimizing the production process. Here we develop a numerical tool for modeling the dynamics of powder particles during additive manufacturing based on force-based simulations by means of the Discrete Element Method (DEM). An existing DEM software (LIGGGHTS) is extended in order to study the transport of powder particles of complex geometric shapes through accounting for the boundary conditions inherent to the manufacturing process. {\copyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

@article{Girolami2012,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we used a 3-D discrete-element model, Grains3D, which allows the simulation of unsteady granular flows of monodisperse soft spherical particles in a common situation (i.e., down a rectangular channel). A series of numerical dam-break experiments was performed to predict the behavior of granular columns that propagate down a rough horizontal surface from different initial conditions (varying the initial aspect ratio). Numerical results were compared to those obtained experimentally by Lajeunesse et al. (Phys Fluids 17:103302, 2005 ) from a similar configuration. Runout distance, temporal flow evolution, deposit morphology and internal flow structures of similar laboratory experiments were quantitatively reproduced as well as prediction of empirical and theoretical scaling laws. This paper highlights that such fully 3-D simulations of soft-spheres can remarkably capture dam-break collapses performed in a rectangular channel. Moreover, Grains3D can provide a complete physical description of such complex unsteady systems which will be the topic of future on-going studies.},

	Abstract = {Although granular materials have always been an important part of our everyday life, their characteristics and behavior is still only rudimentally understood. Therefore the numerical simulation has gained an increasing importance to gain deeper insight into the properties of granular media. One simulation approach is rigid body dynamics. In contrast to particle-based approaches, it fully resolves the granular particles as geometric objects and incorporates frictional contact dynamics. However, due to its complexity and the lack of large-scale parallelization, rigid body dynamics so far could not be used for very large simulation scenarios.   In this paper we demonstrate massively parallel granular media simulations by means of a parallel rigid body dynamics algorithm. We will validate the algorithm for granular gas simulations and prove its scalability on up to 131‚Äâ072 processor cores. Additionally, we will show several parallel granular material simulations both with spherical and non-spherical granular particles.},

The algorithm is stable, second-order accurate, and in its explicit version involves evaluation of only two exponential maps per time step. The semi-explicit version of the proposed scheme improves upon the long-term stability, while it retains the explicitness in the force evaluation. The algebraic structure of both schemes makes them suitable forthe analysis of constrained multi-body systems. The explicit algorithm is specifically aimed at the analysis involving small incremental rotations, where its modest computational cost becomes the major advantage.

	Abstract = {We suggest a novel variant of Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the flow dynamics of granular material made of non-spherical particles. Our approach is limited to particles of convex shape but permits to consider any combination of shape and size, which makes it very versatile. The contact detection strategy relies on the use of the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm to compute the distance between two convex bodies. The validation of the method is based on two different test cases in three dimensions: (i) the formation of a packed pile in a cylindrical container and (ii) flow dynamics in a horizontal rotating drum. In both cases, four shapes are investigated: a sphere, a cylinder, a cube and a tetrahedron. We evidence that our numerical code, Grains3D, supplies reliable and reasonably accurate computed solutions, both for spherical and non-spherical particles. In particular, in the latter case, we show how angularity promotes the appearance of the avalanching regime at relatively high Froude number compared to the spherical counterpart. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	Abstract = {Solfec is a computational code aimed at simulation of constrained multibody systems on distributed memory parallel computers. It implements an instance of the Contact Dynamics (CD) method by Moreau and Jean, hence the constraints are handled implicitly. One of the main goals of the software is to provide a user friendly platform for testing formulations and solution methods for the (dynamic) frictional contact problem. It is also meant to serve as a development platform for other aspects of time-stepping methods (e.g. contact detection, time integration, kinematic models). The purpose of this communication is to outline the algorithmic ideas behind Solfec, with an emphasis on the Gauss--Seidel constraints solver, a classical element of CD, efficiently implemented on a distributed memory model. The remaining topics include a dynamic domain decomposition balancing the computational load of the overall algorithm, and an accuracy measure for the frictional contact constraints. Solfec is an open-source software and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/solfec.},

	Abstract = {For decades, rigid body dynamics has been used in several active research fields to simulate the behavior of completely undeformable, rigid bodies. Due to the focus of the simulations to either high physical accuracy or real time environments, the state-of-the-art algorithms cannot be used in excess of several thousand rigid bodies. Either the complexity of the algorithms would result in infeasible runtimes, or the simulation could no longer satisfy the real time aspects.   In this paper we present a novel approach for large-scale rigid body dynamics simulations. The presented algorithm enables for the first time rigid body simulations of several million rigid bodies. We describe in detail the parallel rigid body algorithm and its necessary extensions for a large-scale MPI parallelization and analyze the parallel algorithm by means of a particular simulation scenario.},

	Abstract = {We describe an efficient algorithm for the simulation of large sets of non-convex rigid bodies. The algorithm finds a simultaneous solution for a multi-body system that is linear in the total number of contacts detected in each iteration. We employ a novel contact model that uses mass, location, and velocity information from all contacts, at the moment of maximum compression, to constrain rigid body velocities. We also develop a new friction model in the configuration space of rigid bodies. These models are used to compute the feasible velocity and the fractional response of each body. Implementation is simple and leads to a fast rigid body simulator that computes steps on the order of seconds for simulations involving over one thousand non-convex objects in high contact configurations.

	Abstract = {Responding to a lack in the literature, mechanical properties of polygonal wood particles are determined for use in a discrete element model (DEM) for flow analysis in silos, and some methods are proposed for determining such parameters. The parameters arrived at here have also formed part of the input to the SPOLY software, developed in-house to compute the DEM model with spheropolyhedron elements. The model is validated using a 2D physical model, where 'prismatic' particles with polygonal cross sections are placed inside a silo with variable aperture and hopper angle. Validation includes comparison of flow-rates computed by SPOLY, displacement profiles, and clogging thresholds with experimental results. The good agreement that emerges will encourage future use of miniature triaxial tests, grain-surface profilometry, inclined slope tests, and numerical analysis of the intragranular stresses-toward a direct construction of the contact-deformation relations required in realistic DEM modelling of particle flow with angular-shaped particles.

	Abstract = {The triangle-to-triangle intersection test is a basic component of all collision detection data structures and algorithms. This paper presents a fast method for testing whether two triangles embedded in three dimensions intersect. Our technique solves the basic sets of linear equations associated with the problem and exploits the strong relations between these sets to speed up their solution. Moreover, unlike previous techniques, with very little additional cost, the exact intersection coordinates can be determined. Finally, our technique uses general principles that can be applied to similar problems such as rectangle-to-rectangle intersection tests, and generally to problems where several equation sets are strongly related. We show that our algorithm saves about 20{\%} of the mathematical operations used by the best previous triangle-to-triangle intersection algorithm. Our experiments also show that it runs 18.9{\%} faster than the fastest previous algorithm on average for typical scenarios of collision detection (on Pentium 4).},

It is a convenient graphical tool for displaying the trade-off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data, as the regularization parameter varies. The L-curve thus gives insight into the regularizing properties of the underlying regularization method, and it is an aid in choosing an appropriate regularization parameter for the given data. In this chapter we summarize the main properties of the L-curve, and demonstrate by examples its usefulness and its limitations both as an analysis tool and as a method for choosing the regularization parameter. 1 Introduction Practically all regularization methods for computing stable solutions to inverse problems involve a trade-off between the "size" of the regularized solution and the quality of the fit that it provides to the given data.

	Abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter--atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently --- those with short--range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed--memory parallel machine which allows for message--passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard--Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers---the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y--MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840--node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade--offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations of biological macromolecules in explicitly modeled solvent typically require the evaluation of interactions between all pairs of atoms separated by no more than some distance R, with more distant interactions handled using some less expensive method. Performing such simulations for periods on the order of a millisecond is likely to require the use of massive parallelism. The extent to which such simulations can be efficiently parallelized, however, has historically been limited by the time required for interprocessor communication. This article introduces a new method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions that significantly reduces the amount of data transferred between processors by comparison with traditional methods. Specifically, the amount of data transferred into and out of a given processor scales as O(R(3/2)p(-1/2)), where p is the number of processors, and with constant factors that should yield a substantial performance advantage in practice.},

The applicability of such simulations is often limited by the time required for calculation, but the use of massive parallelism to accelerate these computations is typically limited by inter-processor communication requirements. Recently, Snir [M. Snir, A note on N-body computations with cutoffs, Theor. Comput. Syst. 37 (2004) 295-318] and Shaw [D.E. Shaw, A fast, scalable method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions, J. Comput. Chem. 26 (2005) 1318-1328] independently introduced two distinct methods that offer asymptotic reductions in the amount of data transferred between processors. In the present paper, we show that these schemes represent special cases of a more general class of methods, and introduce several new algorithms in this class that offer practical advantages over all previously described methods for a wide range of problem parameters. We also show that several of these algorithms approach an approximate lower bound on inter-processor data transfer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, although the investments in these separate software elements have been tremendously valuable, a great deal of productivity has also been lost because of the lack of planning, coordination, and key integration of technologies necessary to make them work together smoothly and efficiently, both within individual petascale systems and between different systems. It seems clear that this completely uncoordinated development model will not provide the software needed to support the unprecedented parallelism required for peta/ exascale computation on millions of cores, or the flexibility required to exploit new hardware models and features, such as transactional memory, speculative execution, and graphics processing units. This report describes the work of the community to prepare for the challenges of exascale computing, ultimately combing their efforts in a coordinated International Exascale Software Project.},

	Abstract = {The relentless pace of Moore's Law will lead to modern multi-core processors, coprocessors and GPU designs with extensive on-die integration of SIMD execution units on CPU and GPU cores to achieve better performance and power efficiency. To make efficient use of the underlying SIMD hardware, utilizing its wide vector registers and SIMD instructions such as Xeon Phi{\texttrademark}, SIMD vectorization plays a key role of converting plain scalar C/C++ code into SIMD code that operating on vectors of data each holding one or more elements. Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} coprocessor is based on the Intel{\textregistered} Many Integrated Core (Intel{\textregistered} MIC) architecture, which is an innovative new processor architecture that combines abundant thread parallelism with long SIMD vector units. Efficiently exploiting SIMD vector units is one of the most important aspects in achieving high performance of the application code running on Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} coprocessors. In this paper, we present several effective SIMD vectorization techniques such as less-than-full-vector loop vectorization, Intel{\textregistered} MIC specific alignment optimization, and small matrix transpose/multiplication 2-D vectorization implemented in the Intel{\textregistered} C/C++ and Fortran production compilers for Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} coprocessors. A set of workloads from several application domains is employed to conduct the performance study of our SIMD vectorization techniques. The performance results show that we achieved up to 12.5x performance gain on the Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} coprocessor. We also demonstrate a 2000x performance speedup from the seamless integration of SIMD vectorization and parallelization.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a method to generate efficient vectorized implementations of small stride permutations using only vector load and vector shuffle instructions. These permutations are crucial for high-performance numerical kernels including the fast Fourier transform. Our generator takes as input only the specification of the target platform's SIMD vector ISA and the desired permutation. The basic idea underlying our generator is to model vector instructions as matrices and sequences of vector instructions as matrix formulas using the Kronecker product formalism. We design a rewriting system and a search mechanism that applies matrix identities to generate those matrix formulas that have vector structure and minimize a cost measure that we define. The formula is then translated into the actual vector program for the specified permutation. For three important classes of permutations, we show that our method yields a solution with the minimal number of vector shuffles. Inserting into a fast Fourier transform yields a significant speedup.},

@article{Alvarez2007,
	Abstract = {Although SIMD extensions are a cost effective way to exploit the data level parallelism present in most media applications, we will show that they had have a very limited memory architecture with a weak support for unaligned memory accesses. In video codec, and other applications, the overhead for accessing unaligned positions without an efficient architecture support has a big performance penalty and in some cases makes vectorization counter-productive. In this paper we analyze the performance impact of extending the Altivec SIMD ISA with unaligned memory operations. Results show that for several kernels in the H.264/AVC media codec, unaligned access support provides a speedup up to 3.8times compared to the plain SIMD version, translating into an average of 1.2times in the entire application. In addition to providing a significant performance advantage, the use of unaligned memory instructions makes programming SIMD code much easier both for the manual developer and the auto vectorizing compiler},

@article{Eichenberger2004,
	Abstract = {When vectorizing for SIMD architectures that are commonly employed by today's multimedia extensions, one of the new challenges that arise is the handling of memory alignment. Prior research has focused primarily on vectorizing loops where all memory references are properly aligned. An important aspect of this problem, namely, how to vectorize misaligned memory references, still remains unaddressed. This paper presents a compilation scheme that systematically vectorizes loops in the presence of misaligned memory references. The core of our technique is to automatically reorganize data in registers to satisfy the alignment requirement imposed by the hardware. To reduce the data reorganization overhead, we propose several techniques to minimize the number of data reorganization operations generated. During the code generation, our algorithm also exploits temporal reuse when aligning references that access contiguous memory across loop iterations. Our code generation scheme guarantees to never load the same data associated with a single static access twice. Experimental results indicate near peak speedup factors, e.g., 3.71 for 4 data per vector and 6.06 for 8 data per vector, respectively, for a set of loops where 75{\%} or more of the static memory references are misaligned.},
