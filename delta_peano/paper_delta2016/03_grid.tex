\section{Grid meta data structures}
\label{section:grid}

Various speedup techniques such as linked-cell lists \cite{Eckhardt2014} and Verlet lists
\cite{Fleissner, Eckhardt2014} reduce the quadratic complexity in DEM codes.
We propose to rely on a generalised tree-based linked-cell
technique that allows us to efficiently treat particles from a vast range of diameters.
Three observations support this design decision:
First, particles colliding with other particles are close to these particles.
It is sufficient to scan a certain environment around each particle for
potential collision partners.
We thus split up the domain into control volumes.
They are cubic as this simplifies the implementation compared to control volumes
of more flexible shapes.
Second, we may choose these control volumes to be larger than the biggest
particle diameter. 
For a particle held in a particular control volume (cell), it is thus sufficient
to check the $3^d-1$ neighbouring cells whether they host other particles that
might collide. 
$d$ is the spatial dimension.
Third, the previous decision is problematic if the particles are of extremely
different size. 
The cell size is determined by the largest particle diameter. 
If we use a uniform cell size, many unnecessary collision checks are performed
for small particles.
If we use an adaptive grid, it is tricky to design the grid such that only
direct neighbouring cells have to be studied.
We thus, third, observe that a cascade of grids might be useful: If we have
several grids embedded into each other, we can store each particle in the grid
suiting its diameter.
Particles of one grid then have to be checked agains particles in their
neighbouring cell as well as neighbouring cells on coarser grid resolution
levels.
There is no need to check a particle of one grid resolution with particles of a
finer grid resolution---if a particle $A$ collides with a particle $B$, particle
$B$ also collides with particle $A$ and such relations thus are already
detected.

A spacetree is a space-partitioning data structure constructed recursively.
The computational domain is embedded into a unit cube.
We cut the unit cube into three equidistant pieces along each coordinate axis. 
This yields 27 new cubes. 
They are called children of the bounding box cube which is the root.
For each of the children, we continue recursively to evaluate the split
decision. 
The decision to cut into three parts results from the fact that we rely on a
code base based upon three-partitioning \cite{Software:Peano}.
Bipartitioning, i.e.~the classic octree, works as well.


The construction scheme yields a cascade of ragged regular Cartesian grids that
are embedded into each other.
Each cell besides the root has a unique parent cell.
While we could make the cells hold particles, we propose to use a
multiscale, vertex-based scheme spanning a dual meta grid
\cite{Weinzierl:16:PIC}.
A vertex is unique through its spatial position plus its level. 
The level is the number of refinement steps required at least to create one of
its adjacent cells.
Each vertex holds a list of particles.
A particles is always stored on the finest grid level where the cells' edge
length is still bigger than its diameter.
A particle is always associated to the vertex next to its geometric centre,
i.e.~any vertex has a list of all particles close to it on the same level.
Links from the vertices to the particles are realised as pointers. 
If a particle moves, we have to update the links, but we do not move
geometric data in memory.

{\bf Regular grid.}
The spacetree formalism allows us to realise at least three grid variants. 
A very simple refines all spacetree nodes all the time as long as the resulting
cell mesh size is bigger than the largest particle diameter.
Such a strategy yields a regular Cartesian grid.
