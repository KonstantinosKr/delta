All underlying software is free and open source C++ code.
\DeltaSoftware\ is available from \cite{Software:Delta} and offers all the
functionality introduced in Section \ref{section:vectorisation} through
\ref{section:domain-decomposition}.
All spacetree and adaptive mesh refinement routines (Section ref{section:grid}) used in the
present work rely on the framework Peano
\cite{Software:Peano,Weinzierl:2009:Diss,Weinzierl:11:Peano}.
All geometric operations as well as DEM-specific compute kernels however are
independent of Peano and can be used with any other (spacetree-based) software.

We offer \DeltaSoftware\ with single (\texttt{float}) and double
(\texttt{double}).
The accuracy is controlled via a compile flag \texttt{-DiREAL=}.
Subject of study here is exlusively \texttt{double}. 
Studies on reduced accuracy computations are beyond the scope of the present
work.
