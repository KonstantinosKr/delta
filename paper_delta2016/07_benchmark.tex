To validate the impact of using spherical versus non-spherical granulates on a simulation experiment we setup a classic granulates hopper flow simulation. In hopper flow simulation we observe the impact that geometry has in the kinematics and general validation of physics.

In our experiement we use a conic shaped hopper that accepts a number a granulates in it is top inlet then with application of gravity it compresses the particles into an outflow from the its bottom outlet. The hopper flow process is vital in areas of process engineering and powder processing technologies.
