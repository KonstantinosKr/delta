<h1>Funding, roadmap &amp; support</h1>


<p>
Peano evolved from my Ph.D. project and was used by a couple of research projects throughout the years. 
Because of its open source license/paradigm, work from these projects helped to maintain and extend the software. 
The most significant grants are enlisted below. 
Because of the software's non-commercial character, there is no real support available: this is not a community service but an active research topic and enabler of its own.
However, the maillist provides a good starting point to ask for help, there is a quick starter available, and we are always open for discussions on future features and fixes, as we appreciate if others use the tool.

<p>
Peano's roadmap is driven solely by the research interest and research projects of the developers.
Specific requests concerning upcoming features should be addressed to the project's mail (info(at)peano-framework.org). 
Currently, the following items have highest priority:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhance the software's suitability to multi-Xeon Phi capabilities.</li>
  <li>Study the software's scaling on SuperMUC. Dynamic load balancing is of particular interest. 
    This will not be available through Peano - Peano provides interfaces to plug in load 
    balancing - but will feedback on this interface and eventually lead into a toolbox
    made available here.
  </li> 
  <li>Identify software requirements w.r.t. hyperbolic equation system solvers based upon patches, i.e. embedded regular Cartesian grids.</li>
  <li>Document the usage to help other developers with rapid prototyping.</li>
</ul>
