/**
 * FCFS Node Pool Strategy
 *
 * This is a very simple node pool strategy. It was written to enable Peano
 * users to come up with a running parallel prototype fast, but it is not
 * tuned to any pde-specific properties. It thus makes sense to implement
 * NodePoolStrategy independently for a given project. This one answers any
 * request on a FCFS basis.

     * Node Pool List Entry Storing Status of Node
     *
     * One instance in the whole application has to keep track of the ranks
     * available, which of them are idle, and whether some of them belong to others,
     * i.e. have to communicate a lot/very fast with special other ranks. These
     * relations are represented by a node pool list entry. By this class.
     *
     * In the application's realisation, the node pool does not administer the
     * collection of ranks and their state itself. Instead, it delegates this job to
     * the node pool strategy. This strategy can be adopted to the concrete problem
     * and the concrete hardware, in particular supercomputer topology.
