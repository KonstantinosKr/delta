/**
 * Parallel Node Representant
 *
 * Represents a program instance within a cluster. Thus, this class is a
 * singleton.
 *
 * The parallel concept is a client - server model (process 0 is the server),
 * where all active nodes act as servers deploying calculations on demand. So
 * the basic activities of a parallel node are
 *
 * - receive new root element to work on
 * - pass back space-tree
 * - perform additive cycle
 * - perform multiplicative cycle
 *
 * The two perform commands have to return several statistic records. Among them
 * are time needed, some residual characteristics and flags defining if the
 * domain has been refined. Furthermore the number of communication partners is
 * an interesting detail.
 *
 * In the near future, this class should become responsible for the error
 * handling. Right now, the error handle set is the fatal error handler. That
 * is the whole parallel application is shut down as soon as an mpi error
 * occurs.

     *
     * Originally, I put the shutdown operation into the destructor of Node.
     * The MPI environment consequently was shut down as soon as the operating
     * system terminates the application. However, Scalasca complained on the
     * BlueGene/P that the
     * destruction happened after the return statement of the main method. To
     * make Peano work with Scalasca, I hence moved the MPI shutdown into a
     * method called explicitely before the final return statement.
     *
     * This seems to be a CLX effect, i.e. the Intel and the GNU compilers
     * worked fine with Scalasca. Hence, I assume that Intel and GNU
     * executables destroy all static objects (singletons) before they return
     * from the main functions. CLX destroys the static objects after the
     * return statement and thus makes Scalasca's instrumentation report an
     * error.
