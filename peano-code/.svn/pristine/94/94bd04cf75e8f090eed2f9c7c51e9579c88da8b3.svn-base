/**
 * Node Pool (Manager of Nodes)
 *
 * The node pool represents the pool of all processes available for parallel
 * computing. It holds the status of all the nodes. Hereby, the node pool of
 * the master processor is the only valid one. The other processors do not have
 * a node pool, but use the node pool as interface to access remotely the node
 * pool on rank 0. Consequently, some operations might be available on rank 0
 * only, while others are available to all ranks.
 *
 * There are basically four features implemented by this class:
 *
 * || Feature        || Operations       || For which rank || Semantics
 * |  Job management | waitForJob()      |  rank>0         |  The operation terminates as soon as the local node is assigned a job or the whole program terminates.
 * |                 | reserveFreeNode() |  all ranks      |  Get a new worker for my rank.
 * |  Hierarchy management | getMasterNodeNumber() | rank>0 | Returns the rank of the master node, i.e. of the node who has requested me as a worker.
 * |  Management     | setStrategy()     |  rank=0         |  Define which load balancing strategy to choose.
 * |                 | terminate()       |  rank=0         |  Shut down application, i.e. tell all nodes to terminate.
 *
 * The whole thing is a service on rank 0, i.e. it runs in the background of the
 * application, and regulary polls the MPI queues.
 *
 * !!! Tagging
 *
 * The node pool uses a number of tags to exchange data with the other nodes.
 * Tags are dynamically received from the node.
 *
 * || Tag || Semantics  || Message types sent on this tag
 * |  _registrationTag  | Administer overview of ranks. |  RegisterAtNodePoolMessage
 * |  _jobManagementTag | Do the rank/work assignment.  |  JobRequestMessage
 * |                    |                               |  ActivationMessage
 * |  _jobServicesTag   | Poll for new workers.         |  WorkerRequestMessage
 * |                    |                               |  NodePoolAnswerMessage
 *
 * A detailed overview of the different message types and their semantics can
 * be found no the directory's page.

     * operation to receive the number of a new client or a NoFreeNodesMessage.

     * If fair scheduling is switched on, it usually takes a certain time until
     * the node pool server sends back the answer. For this time the client
     * could sleep and allow other tasks to work. This is especially important
     * if a node is overloaded. Yet, if no worker is available, the node pool
     * server answers immediately and there's no reason to sleep for the asking

     * the operation. The following table gives the transitions.
     *
