     * Produces an economy-size QR decomposition of a matrix A, A is changed.
     *
     * Preconditions:
     * - The column vectors of A have to be linear independent.
     * - If A has n columns and m rows, then:
     *   * n <= m for A
     *   * Q has to have same size than A
     *   * R has to be a n * n matrix
     *
     * Postconditions:
     * - A is changed
     * - Q holds an orthonormal basis of range(A) in its column vectors.
     * - R is an upper triangular matrix, with all main diagonal element unequal
     *   to zero iff A has full rank.
     *
     * The algorithm is taken from the book Numerical Mathematics, Second Edition,
     * by Alfio Querteroni, Riccardo Sacco, and Fausto Saleri, Springer, 2007,
     * pages 85-87.
