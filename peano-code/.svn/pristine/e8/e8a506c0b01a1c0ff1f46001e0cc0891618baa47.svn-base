/**
 * A simple class that has to be included to measure the clock ticks required
 * for an operation. To use it you've to create an instance of this class at
 * the beginning of the operation block you want to measure the time spent
 * within it:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   void anyOperation() {
 *     utils::Watch watch("MyClass","anyOperation()");
 *     ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The result the of the measurement is written to log.info level. Note that
 * this operation works within operation blocks (e.g. a for-loop), too.
 *
 * For an extended measurement of calender (i.e. user) time and a saving of the
 * data and access via getters, we implemented parts of what Markus Langlotz
 * gave us for the ancient stokes project. Additionally, the counter overflow
 * and the non-access to the measured time were reasons for introducing this
 * extended version. Furthermore, we now may choose specific computation
 * intervals to be counted in between the start and the stop command.
 *
