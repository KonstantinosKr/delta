PDT tarball

This tarball holds the whole pdt. Usually, there is no need to unzip this file 
as Peano comes along with an executable jar file to run the pdt (see 
www.peano-framework.org). However, if you wish to unzip the pdt sources, I 
recommend to put it into a separate directory. The sources also stem from a 
sourceforge directory called pdt.
