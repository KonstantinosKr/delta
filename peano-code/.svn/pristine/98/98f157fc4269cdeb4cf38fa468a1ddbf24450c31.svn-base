This directory holds the core archives and tools for the Peano framework. Notably,
it holds the Peano sources (peano.tar.gz) and the Peano Development Toolkit (PDT).
The latter is a Java tool provided as jar file and as sources. From time to time, 
we experience problems with different Java versions when we use the jar file. In 
this case, please download the Java sources and rebuild the PDT. Otherwise, you 
might write an email to the Peano maillist and ask for a particular jar build.
