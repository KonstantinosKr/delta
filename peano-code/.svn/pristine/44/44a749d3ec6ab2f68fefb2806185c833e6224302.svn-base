 @dir "Performance Analysis"
 
 This directory is kind of a plotter for performance analysis data. It follows few guidelines:
 
 - Logged data is application-specific, i.e. we do not focus on technical details.
 - All passed data is built-in types. Strings are not passed.
 - Watches, string construction, etc. all are used if and only if the corresponding log filters
   are switched off, i.e. if the messages would pass through. 
 - On the long term, I would like to make the performanceanalysis guide the load
   balancing and also the autotuning. Those components should realise how to 
   improve the performance while this component should derive the performance metrics.
  
 !!! Additional files
 
 - The pngs and svgs in this directory are backups of the files used in the wiki.
 - The scripts are pure
