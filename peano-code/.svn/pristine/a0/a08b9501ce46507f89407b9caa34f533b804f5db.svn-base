     * Store cells
     *
     * This operation is a recursive operation running through all levels
     * bottom-up. It first waits until all events have been called for a
     * given level. This wait immediately terminates if no events are called
     * in parallel, i.e. if no ascend process is running in parallel.
     *
     * Afterwards, it invokes storedCellOfRegularRefinedGrid(), i.e. it
     * switches the input and output stack statistics (how many vertices are
     * stored/read from which stack) and streams the cell to the output
     * stream. If the vertex push process is running in parallel, we may not
     * invert the statistics on the regular grid data structures, as these
     * properties might be required by the store vertex process. Instead, this
     * process graps a copy of the cells and streams the copy to the output
     * stack.
     *
     * !!! Inefficiency patterns
     *
     * If the cell storage is ran in parallel to the cell processing
     * (pipelining), it can happen that the process waits quite some time
     * before it can start to store the cells actually. In this case, it does
     * not permanently poll the cell state, but it moves to the background
     * several times (see the macro sendThisTaskToBackground).
     *
     * If it has to wait too long, it writes a warning. In this case, it
     * might make sense to switch off pipelining for the store process -
     * obviously the store process has to wait that long before it can start
     * that it does make more sense to invest all computational ressources no
     * the processing and afterwards run the store process serially.
