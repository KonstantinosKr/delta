/**

 @dir "Multicore"

 To compile with multicore support, we currently offer three variants:
 
 -DSharedOMP       OpenMP    Not maintained at the moment due to a lack of time
 -DSharedTBB       TBB       Default
 -SharedTBBInvade  TBB       Invasive variant of TBB (collaboration with Martin Schreiber, Exceter)

 
 If you wanna distinguish in your code between multicore and no-multicore variants, 
 please use
\code
#include "tarch/multicore/MulticoreDefinitions.h"
\endcode
and  
\code
#if defined(SharedMemoryParallelisation)
\endcode
 With the symbol $SharedMemoryParallelisation$, you make your code independent of 
 OpenMP or TBB.
