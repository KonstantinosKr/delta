/**
 * Load balancing oracle
 *
 * The load distribution in Peano is (logically) a tree topology. Whenever the
 * grid is traversed, basically startup messages are passed top-down and state
 * messages are passed bottom-up. Such a scheme naturally yields master-worker
 * relations. Whenever data or algorithms are duplicated, always the master has
 * the responsibility and the correct data. It is never the worker.
 *
 * The oracles run on every node. Whenever the tree traversal encounters yet
 * another worker, it asks the local oracle what to do with this worker, i.e.
 * the master decides on the worker. In turn, the oracle on the worker always
 * is informed about the master's decision. It may not veto, but it is
 * informed.

     * Peano is robust with respect to fork attempts if no idle workers are
     * available. If the oracle says fork but no ranks are available, the grid
     * just remains unchanged. However, detecting such a case is expensive:
     * Each time the oracle says fork, a message is sent to the central node
     * pool. This node pool then can answer 'no nodes available'. This is a
     * very flexible concept but introduces a single point of contact.
     *
     * As a consequence, Peano informs the oracle whenever a fork has failed.
     * It then is a good idea for an efficient oracle to skip further fork
     * fork calls for this traversal, i.e. I recommend to return Continue or
     * Join afterwards. Such forkFailed() information is valid only until the
     * next iteration, i.e. I recommend to try again to fork in the next
     * iteration. I recommend to reset internal fork-failed states. The start
     * of a new iteration is mirrored by receivedStartCommand(). So, after
     * the next receivedStartCommand(), forks should be tried again.
     *
     * Alternatively, it might even make sense to wait for a fixed number
     * of receivedStartCommand() calls before the oracle tries to fork the
     * next time.
