 @dir "Autotuning - Shared Memory"
 
 This directory holds the tools for the autotuning. The term tools comprises 
 three types of classes:
 
 - The Oracle is the central contact point for Peano's kernel and also the 
   application-specific code to control and manipulate Peano's multicore 
   behaviour.
 - All classes not starting with Oracle are helper classes. 
 - The oracle mechanism is based upon an expert system tuning the application's 
   behaviour to the PDE. Often, these expert systems have to be tailored to the 
   PDE. Alternatively, there's however a couple of general-purpose oracles 
   learning how the application behaves. 

 The best starting point to learn how the parallelisation is used is the Jacobi 
 tutorial (step three). The best starting point to understand how the 
 autotuning (learning oracles) is designed is a paper by Nogina, Unterweger, 
 and Weinzierl at the PPAM '11. See the literature section to your right on the 
 start page of the sources. The canonical starting point to write a 
 PDE-specific shared memory strategy is the OracleForOnePhase interface.     


 !!! Kernel parallelisation
 
 Besides PDE-specific concurrent routines, Peano also parallelises parts of its 
 kernel. Here, grain sizes are required as well. For those parts, the file 
 KernelGrainSizes.h encodes the grain sizes, as they are PDE independent 
 (though they depend on the architecture for sure).
