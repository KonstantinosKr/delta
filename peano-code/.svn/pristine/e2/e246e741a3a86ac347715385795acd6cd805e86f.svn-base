<h1>Peano - a Framework for Solvers on Spacetree Grids</h1>
<h2>www.peano-framework.org</h2>


<p>
Peano is an open source C++ solver framework. 
It is based upon the fact that spacetrees, a generalisation of the classical 
octree concept, yield a cascade of adaptive Cartesian grids. 
Consequently, any spacetree traversal is equivalent to an element-wise 
traversal of the hierarchy of the adaptive Cartesian grids. 
The software Peano realises such a grid traversal and storage algorithm, and 
it provides hook-in points for applications performing per-element, per-vertex, 
and so forth operations on the grid. 
It also provides interfaces for dynamic load balancing, sophisticated 
geometry representations, and other features.
Some properties are enlisted below.
</p>

<p>
Peano is currently available in its third generation.
The development of the original set of Peano codes started around 2002.
2005-2009, we merged these codes into one Peano kernel (2nd generation).
2009, I started a complete reimplementation of the kernel with special emphasis on
reusability, application-independent design and the support for rapid prototyping.
Currently, HPC challenges and extensions dominate the development.  
All data you can download today are stable, i.e. the interfaces will not change.
Updates to the kernel (in particular to speed up simulations) will be hidden from any application or
will be made available due to additional, non-mandatory APIs.
</p>

<p>
Peano is plain C++ code and depends only on MPI and Intel's TBB or OpenMP if you want 
to run it with distributed or shared memory support.
C++ 11 is used.
There are no further dependencies or libraries required.
If you intend to use Peano, we provide a small Java tool to facilitate rapid 
prototyping and to get rid of writing glue code.
This Peano Development Toolkit (PDT) is pure Java and uses <a href="http://www5.in.tum.de/dastgen/">DaStGen</a>.
While we provide the PDT's sources, there's also a jar file available that comprises all required 
Java libraries and runs stand alone.

<h2>Recent News</h2>

  <li>
    2015-09: <i>Webpage update</i><br />
    Following recommendations of the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a>, I will restructure the webpage throughout the next months. 
    Please pay special attention to the documentation sections.

    2015-08: <i>Data compression</i><br />
    We've added a new class to the heap namespace that allows codes to compress their double and floating point data. The class
    allows codes to prescribe the precision they need. Its methods then decompose the floating point variable such that few 
    chars are sufficient to store the value. Details will be presented in my ParCo 2015 talk.

    2015-04: <i>ExaHyPE</i><br />
    The H2020 project <a href="http://www5.in.tum.de/forschung/exahype/" target="_blank">ExaHyPE</a> got granted. ExaHyPE will rely on Peano as grid management and 
    we will continue to improve the software due to this grant. 
  </li>

    2015-02: <i>Support for particles added</i><br />
    Because of our recent work on particle-in-cell methods (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02435">arXiv preprint</a>), Peano now allows users to embed particles into the grid.
    This is made possible by Peano's heap. I've uploaded a small toolbox that realises the paper's algorithms and allows any application to use particles without any coding to 
    insert them into the cell into which they belong accoring to their position in space. If particles move, the embedding is updated automatically.
