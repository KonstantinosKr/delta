Toolbox for matrix-free solvers (tarball)

This tarball holds tools/helper classes for matrix-free solvers. Most makefiles 
by default expect them to be held by a directory toolboxes, i.e. I recommend to 
unpack these classes into a subdirectory toolboxes parallel to any other Peano 
sources such as Peano's kernel or a project.
