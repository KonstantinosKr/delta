/**
 * Abstract base class of all send receive buffers.
 *
 * This is an abstract base class for all send receive buffers that was
 * introduced for technical reasons. A buffer is a template, i.e. different
 * buffers belonging to different data types are completely unrelated types.
 * The pool has a map holding all these send receive buffers. Consequently, all
 * these template classes need a common superclass. Well, here it is.
 *
 * The perhaps most interesting fact about these buffers is their swap
 * mechanism. It is invoked by the pool's releaseMessages() operation. This one
 * calls releaseSentMessages() and releaseReceivedMessages(), i.e. the swap is
 * split up into two methods. For a more detailed description of these two
 * operations, switch to their description.

     * Within the wait process, the send receive buffer pool is invoked to avoid
     * deadlocks: On some systems (Infiniband, e.g.) big messages with another
     * tag or from another node might block the incoming messages
     * releaseMessages() is waiting for. Node's receiveDanglingMessages() would
     * buffer such blocking messages. To be able to do this, Node polls all the
     * incoming messages and creates incoming buffers for messages if the
     * buffers do not exist via the buffer pool - it creates receive buffers
     * on-the-fly.

     * not managed by the pool. The deadlock aspect now might create an
     * additional buffer throughout the MPI polling. For testing, I thus
     * introduced this bool that switches off the deadlock aspect. Outside of
     * the test cases, the parameter holds.
