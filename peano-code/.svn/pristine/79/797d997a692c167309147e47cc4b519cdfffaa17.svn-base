Tarball holding some shared memory oracles

This tarball holds shared memory oracles. Most makefiles by default expect them 
to be held by a directory toolboxes, i.e. I recommend to unpack these classes 
into a subdirectory toolboxes parallel to any other Peano sources such as 
Peano's kernel or a project.
