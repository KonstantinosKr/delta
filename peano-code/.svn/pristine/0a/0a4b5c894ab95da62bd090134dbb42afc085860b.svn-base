       *   describes size and offset of a regular tree's root element. If the
       *   flag of a vertex is greater Leaf, all 2^d adjacent trees are regular
       *   and have the same height.
       * - If the flag is StationaryButIrregular, the induced tree or the 2^d
       *   adjacent trees, respectively, are stationary yet are not regular, i.e.
       *   define adaptive grids.
       * - The remaining flags are self-explaining.
