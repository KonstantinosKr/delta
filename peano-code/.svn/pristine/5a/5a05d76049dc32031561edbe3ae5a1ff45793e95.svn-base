 @dir "Aspects"
 
 This page describes the aspects of cells and vertices.
 Both cells and vertices have different aspects, i.e. their attributes and 
 operations have different purposes:
 
 - Some attributes and operations represent PDE-specific data.
 - Some attributes and operations represent the cell's/vertex's state in the 
   spacetree.
 - Some operations offer tree statistics, i.e. queries how the underlying tree
   is structured.
 - Some operations offer refinement functionality.
 
 Peano implements a multi-layered strategy to realise these different aspects 
 of the data structure. At the same time, it tries to split up the different 
 aspects into different classes and to hide the functional aspect from each 
 other.

 !!! State in the Spacetree
 
 There's a template class spacetreegrid::Cell holding a DaStGen records 
 _cellData. Consequently, Cell also offers all the state operations. Examples 
 for these operations are 'is this a leaf', can we merge different tree nodes, 
 and so forth. 
 The exact same arguing holds for the vertices.

 !!! PDE-specific Data
 
 The PDE-specific aspects are realised by a subclass of Cell. These subclasses 
 belong to the PDE components (and namespaces) and extend the state accordingly.
 As the PDE-specific data is already incorporated into the DaStGen record, the 
 Cell subclass comprises only operations.
 The exact same arguing holds for the vertices.
 
 !!! Other Aspects 
 
 All the other aspects are deployed to classes of their own. These classes offer 
 solely static operations and are allowed to modify the DaStGen data structure, 
 as they are friends of Cell.
