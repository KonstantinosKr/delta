 Here's a short discussion of some cases of the ascend process:
 
 @image html leaveCell-order.png
 
 Lets assume that we leaveCell is called for the red cell. The red cell is 
 refined. The Peano curve runs as denoted, i.e. somewhere later in the grid 
 traversal, the automaton will process the blue cells. 
 Then the following statements hold:
 
 - leaveCell() has been called for all grey cells before.
 - touchVertexLastTime() has been called for all yellow vertices, i.e. it has 
   been called for all vertices that are completely inside the coarse red cell.  
 - touchVertexLastTime() has been called for the green vertex as the curve runs
   from left to right.
 - touchVertexFirstTime() has been called for the dark blue vertex as the curve runs
   from left to right. However, touchVertexLastTime() has not been called for this 
   vertex.
   
 In general, as you don't know anything about the curve's meandering, you 
 cannot say anything about whether vertices on the finer level that are on the 
 boundary of the red cell have been completely processed.  
 
 Also, as the automaton follows a depth-first tree traversal paradigm, you cannot 
 say anything about the order of leaveCell() and enterCell() for cells that are 
 not in a child-father or child-grandfather or ... relation. The blue cells in 
 the illustration for example are here left (and probably also entered) after the 
 red one has been processed. In the next iteration, this order might change. 
 
 The mights and can from above stem from the fact that Peano sometimes reorders 
 events to run more efficiently on shared memory systems. However, father-child 
 relations are never violated, i.e. enterCell() for a coarse cell is always 
 called before the finer cells contained within this coarse cell are visited. 
 If leaveCell() on a refined cell is called, leaveCell() has been called before 
 for all cells that are contained within this cell.
