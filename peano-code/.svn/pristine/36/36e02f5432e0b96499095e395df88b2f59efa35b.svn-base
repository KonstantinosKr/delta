 The illustration below gives a typical vertex and cell lifecycle.

 - Peano loads vertices from an input stream and calls touchFirstTime() for 
   them. If vertices or cells do not exist before, it creates them a priori.  
 - Peano creates temporary vertices, i.e. hanging nodes, on-the-fly throughout 
   the grid traversal. A hanging vertex at one spatial position might be 
   created and destroyed multiple times throughout the traversal. 
 - Whenever a cell event such as enterCell() is invoked, you can be 
   sure that all the @f$ 2^d @f$ vertices are initialised, i.e. Peano has 
   called either touchFirstTime() or createHangingVertex() before.
 - The hanging vertex will be destroyed before the iteration terminates.
 - Vertices are destroyed or written back to the output stream not before
   leaveCell() has been called.
   
 While touchFirstTime() is called for both inner and boundary vertices, outer 
 vertices are not taken into account. Neither are outer cells. For a 
 description and more details on different geometries consult the 
 peano::geometry documentation. Also, the second step of the Jacobi tutorial 
 (see application::poisson) folder discuss the representation of a geometry 
 by the grid, the different vertex states, and, thus, the implications for the 
 events.
