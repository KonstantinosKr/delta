 Peano relies on a geometry class to identify what the computational domain 
 looks like. However, Peano itself provides only one geometry - the hexahedron.
 More sophisticated geometries are not part of the kernel. Besides this single 
 geometry, some helpers complete the namespace.

 Peano grids look similar to the two illustrations below that both resolve 
 a sphere.

 Interesting about these illustrations is the fact that they illustrate how 
 Peano grids grow towards the real geometry. A Peano cell is inside if and only 
 if it is completely inside a real geometry. As a result, Peano grids grow from 
 inside towards the real geometry boundary. This might imply that a vertex is a 
 boundary or even an outer vertex, while at the same time the same vertex on a 
 one step finer level is inside the domain.
